# remove_instance_id

i found this piece of code i wrote in one of my drives. it tries to remove 
"instanceId" from a query string. maybe it's part of my attempt to fast iterate 
on processing device identifiers in Win32 API output. 

it was still buggy and non-generic, so i rewrote it, and shortened it while
making it expressive. it was fantastic. 

i'm just archiving this.
